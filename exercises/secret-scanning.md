### _**Practical Exercise 1a**_

#### Enabling secret scanning
Secret scanning can be enabled in the settings of an organization or a repository.

1. Go to the repository settings and enable secret scanning in the *Security & analysis* section.

#### Viewing and managing results
After a few minutes, the security tab in the repository will indicate that there are new security alerts.

1. Go to the secret scanning section to view the detected secrets.

For each secret, look at the options to close it and determine which one is most suitable.

#### Introducing a test secret
When developing test cases it might be the case that secrets are introduced that cannot be abused when disclosed. Secret scanning will still detect and alert on these secrets.

1. In the GitHub repository file explorer create a test file that will contain a test secret.
    - For example the file `storage-service/src/main/resources/application.dev.properties` with the secrets
        ```
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIAZBQE345LKPTEAHQD"
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="wt6lVzza0QFx/U33PU8DrkMbnKiu+bv9jheR0h/D"
        ```
2. Determine if the secret is detected when the file is stored.
3. How would you like to manage results from test files?

#### Excluding files from secret scanning
While we can close a detected secret as being used in a test, we can also configure secret scanning to exclude files from being scanned.

1. Create the file `.github/secret_scanning.yml` if it doesn't already exist.
2. Add a list of paths to exclude from secret scanning. You can use [filter patterns](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet) to specify paths.
    ```yaml
    paths-ignore:
        - '**/test'
    ```
    **Note**: The characters `*`, `[`, and `!` are special characters in YAML. If you start a pattern with `*`, `[`, or `!`, you must enclose the pattern in quotes.

    Use a pattern to exclude the file `storage-service/src/main/resources/application.dev.properties`

    <details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    A possible solution is:

    ```yaml
    paths-ignore:
        - '**/test/**'
        - '**/application.dev.properties'
    ```
    </details>

3. Test the pattern by adding another secret or to the file `storage-service/src/main/resources/application.properties`

    For example change the `secretKey` to
    ```
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="6L=yQr6Ivxxj/XG+YdFPdH/xWDcbSV9ch/EjmHCL"
    ```

#### Managing access to alerts
Due to the nature of secrets, the alerts are only visible to organization and repository administrators.
Access to other members and teams can be given in the `Security & analysis` setting.

**Note:** The member or teams requires write privileges before access to alerts can be given.

1. To enable this functionality, we have to enable Dependabot alerts.
2. In the access to alerts section, add another team member or team to provide access to your repository alerts.
