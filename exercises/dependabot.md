### _**Practical Exercise 1b**_

#### Enabling Dependabot alerts
Dependabot can be enabled in the settings of an organization or a repository.

1. Go to the repository settings and enable Dependabot alerts in the *Security & analysis* section.

#### Reviewing the dependency graph
Dependabot uses the dependency graph to determine which dependencies are used by your project.

1. Verify in the dependency graph that it found dependencies for:
    - The frontend service.
    - The authentication service.
    - The gallery service.
    - The storage service.

The dependency graph can be access in the `Insights` tab in your repository.

#### Viewing and managing results

After a few minutes, the security tab in the repository will indicate that there are new security alerts.

**Note**: If this not the case, we can trigger an analysis by updating `authn-service/requirements.txt`

1. Go to the Dependabot alert section to view the detected dependency issues.

For each dependency alert, we have the option to create a security update or to dismiss the alert with a reason.

2. For one of the alerts create a dependency security update. If Dependabot can update the dependency automatically, it will create a PR.

3. For one of the alerts dimiss the alert.

#### Enabling Dependabot security updates

Dependabot can automatically create PRs to upgrade vulnerable dependencies to non-vulnerable versions.

1. Go to the repository settings and enable Dependabot security updates in the *Security & analysis* section.

After a few minutes multiple PRs will be created that will upgrade vulnerable dependencies.


#### Introducing a new vulnerable dependency

  1. Add a [vulnerable dependency](https://github.com/advisories?query=severity%3Ahigh+ecosystem%3Apip) to `auth-service/requirements.txt`. For example:

    ```requirements.txt
    ...
    django==2.1.0
    ```
  2. Open a pull request 
  3. Review the dependency graph changes in the pull request.


#### Configuring Dependabot security updates

To successfully integrate the security updates into the SDLC, it is possible to configure various aspects such as:

- When security PRs are created.
- What labels are assigned to enable filtering options.
- Who is assigned to the PR and who should review it.
- Specify which dependency are updated and how they are updated.

Create the file `.github/dependabot.yml` in your repository and configure the `pip` dependency manager to:
  1. Look for dependency information in the directory `authn-service`.

  2. Schedule daily security updates.

  3. Prefix the commit message with the package manager `pip`.

  4. Assign the PR to yourself and a person from your workshop team as a reviewer.

  5. Add the custom label `triage-required` to enable filtering of the PRs (Make sure the label exists by adding it to `https://github.com/githubuniverseworkhops/<your repo>/labels`).

  6. Verify your changes by adding, and merging, a [vulnerable dependency](https://github.com/advisories?query=severity%3Ahigh+ecosystem%3Apip) to `auth-service/requirements.txt`. For example:

    ```requirements.txt
    ...
    django==2.1.0
    ```

How would you know if the configuration cannot be satisfied?

1. Add a non-existing label to the configuration.

2. Trigger a new dependabot security update by adding a vulnerable dependency to one of the projects
   For example, we can add the dependency `django-two-factor-auth==1.11` to `auth-service/requirements.txt`

3. Look at the created PR to determine if the configuration has been satisfied.
